  The description should include th following sections structure, all of these titles in Spanish:  
  
  - **DescripciÃ³n**: A high-level summary of the changes made. This section **must include a clear and detailed explanation of the modifications, improvements, or new functionalities introduced**. The overall summary should be **integrated into this section, not placed separately at the end**.  
  - **Added Files (in spanish)**: A list of newly added files.  
  - **Modified Files (in spanish)**: A list of modified files.  
  - **Deleted Files (in spanish)**: A list of deleted files.  
  - **Change Details (in spanish)**: A breakdown of the changes made to each added or modified file. **Ensure that changes affecting business logic, API integrations (e.g., SOAP to REST migrations), and system architecture are explicitly mentioned and analyzed in depth.**  
  
  ðŸš¨ **Important**:  
  - Do **not** add an additional summary at the end of the document.  
  - Ensure that all relevant changes, including API modifications, business logic updates, and architectural improvements, are properly identified and described.  
  - If a major refactor is detected, explain how it improves performance, maintainability, or security.
  - Tiiles must have the special markdown format (e.g., # Title).
